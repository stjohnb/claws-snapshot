# Database Schema

Claws uses SQLite (via `better-sqlite3`) stored at `~/.claws/claws.db`.
The database is configured with WAL journal mode and NORMAL synchronous
level for performance.

**Source**: `src/db.ts`

## `tasks` table

Tracks every job invocation. Used for crash recovery (orphaned task detection
at startup) and operational visibility.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------|
| `id` | INTEGER | PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT | Unique task identifier |
| `job_name` | TEXT | NOT NULL | Job that created this task (e.g. `issue-worker`, `ci-fixer`) |
| `repo` | TEXT | NOT NULL | Full repo name (e.g. `St-John-Software/claws`) |
| `item_number` | INTEGER | NOT NULL | Issue or PR number (0 for doc-maintainer) |
| `trigger_label` | TEXT | nullable | Label that triggered this task |
| `worktree_path` | TEXT | nullable | Filesystem path to the task's worktree |
| `branch_name` | TEXT | nullable | Git branch name used by this task |
| `run_id` | TEXT | nullable | UUID of the parent job run (links to `job_runs.run_id`) |
| `status` | TEXT | NOT NULL, default `'running'` | One of: `running`, `completed`, `failed` |
| `error` | TEXT | nullable | Error message if status is `failed` |
| `started_at` | TEXT | NOT NULL | ISO timestamp when task started |
| `completed_at` | TEXT | nullable | ISO timestamp when task finished |

### Indexes

- `idx_tasks_status` on `status` — used by `getOrphanedTasks()` to find
  rows still in `running` state at startup
- `idx_tasks_run_id` on `run_id` — used by `getTasksByRunId()` and
  `getWorkItemsForRuns()` to fetch tasks for a specific job run

### Lifecycle

1. **Start**: `recordTaskStart()` inserts a row with status `running` and
   the current `run_id` (from `AsyncLocalStorage` context, linking the task
   to its parent job run)
2. **Worktree created**: `updateTaskWorktree()` fills in `worktree_path` and
   `branch_name` (these are null initially because they're set after the
   worktree is created)
3. **Complete**: `recordTaskComplete()` sets status to `completed` with
   timestamp
4. **Failed**: `recordTaskFailed()` sets status to `failed` with error
   message and timestamp

### Crash Recovery

`getOrphanedTasks()` returns all rows with `status = 'running'`. At startup,
`main.ts` iterates these and:
- Removes the worktree directory if it still exists on disk
- Marks the task as `failed` with error `"process restarted before completion"`

## `job_runs` table

Tracks each scheduled job execution. Created automatically on DB init.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------|
| `id` | INTEGER | PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT | Auto-increment ID |
| `run_id` | TEXT | NOT NULL UNIQUE | UUID identifying this run |
| `job_name` | TEXT | NOT NULL | Name of the job (e.g. `issue-worker`) |
| `status` | TEXT | NOT NULL, default `'running'` | One of: `running`, `completed`, `failed` |
| `started_at` | TEXT | NOT NULL | ISO timestamp when the run started |
| `completed_at` | TEXT | nullable | ISO timestamp when the run finished |

### Indexes

- `idx_job_runs_job_name` on `job_name`
- `idx_job_runs_started_at` on `started_at` — used by pruning

## `job_logs` table

Stores log output captured during job runs via `AsyncLocalStorage` context.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------|
| `id` | INTEGER | PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT | Auto-increment ID |
| `run_id` | TEXT | NOT NULL | UUID of the parent job run |
| `level` | TEXT | NOT NULL | Log level: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, or `error` |
| `message` | TEXT | NOT NULL | The log message |
| `logged_at` | TEXT | NOT NULL | ISO timestamp when the log was written |

### Indexes

- `idx_job_logs_run_id` on `run_id` — used to fetch logs for a specific run

### Pruning

Old runs and logs are pruned on startup and daily via `pruneOldLogs()`.
Retention is configured via `logRetentionDays` (default: 14 days) and
`logRetentionPerJob` (default: 20) in `~/.claws/config.json`. The pruner
deletes runs older than the retention period but always keeps the most
recent N runs per job type. Orphaned log entries are cascade-deleted.
